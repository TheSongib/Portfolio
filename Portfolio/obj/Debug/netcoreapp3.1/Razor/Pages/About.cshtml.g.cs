                Hi! I'm Brandon and I wanted to make a page to get to know me on a more personal level since the application and hiring process can be very analytical and impersonal.
                I am a junior at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.  I've lived in the greater Cincinnati area my entire life, but as I've gotten older I have wanted to move around to experience living in different places.
                I have two daschunds, Sara and Penny, and they are mother (Sara) and daughter (Penny).

                <br />
                While I haven't gotten the chance to live anywhere else, I have been fortunate enough to do a lot of traveling.  I have traveled to a wide variety of places in the US, and also Mexico, ");
            WriteLiteral(@"Canada, the UK, France, Spain, and Portugal, but I hope to continue to travel
                in the future.  I found traveling in Europe to be the most impactful since I had never experienced a culture that was much different than the US.  This gave me a whole new perspective on how different places can be in the world, and how different cultures can have
                entirely different ways of doing things.

                Probably the most interseting fact about me is that I have climbed a moutain.  I climbed the Grand Teton (elevation 13,776â€²) in Wyoming when I was 15 years old.  This was a major accomplishment for me, and something that I trained 
                for for months prior.  Overall, it was a good experience, but it isn't something I have a desire to do again.  It was a lot of work, and very rewarding, but I didn't enjoy the actual moutain climbing enough to make it worth doing again for me.

                    This is probably the most obvious hobby of mine given my career choice, so I'll start here.  I first started enjoying playing video games in the 5 grade when I got an Xbox for Christmas.  This started my
                    hobby of playing video games in my free time.  When I was about 13, I wanted to build a computer to play video games on, and within a few years, at about 15 years old, I was able to pursue building my first computer.
                    From following tutorials on YouTube, I was able to accomplish this and build a working computer.  I did build it to play video games on, but this spark");

                    I wanted to build games and eventually programs in general to make my computer do something from what I coded.  My first taste of this was in 8th grade robotics class when I had to code a small robot to do simple
                    things with only if statements and while loops, and ever since then I have loved computer coding.

                    Since being introduced to video games and computers, I have continued to enjoy all things video game and computer related.
                    Most recently, in the summer of 2018 I built an entirely new desktop computer that is much improved over what I had before.  The following summer in 2019 I built a server computer.  This was not only super enjoyable to me
                    but I also learned a lot about servers compared to regular computers, and continue to learn about and maintain  the server in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS ");

                    starting my college career, I have had a lot of fun creating fun side projects, such as this portfolio or making small Java games. Also more recently, I have really enjoyed watching eSports in my favorite video game, Rocket League.

                    boxing, and joined the Miami University Boxing Club with a friend.  I spend most of my time in this club so far just training my boxing skills, and just started sparring for the first time a week before going remote due to Covid-19.

                    This past summer I have also dove into golfing.  Golfing has always peaked my interest since it is a more relaxing sport which I find fun and relaxing.  I started actually golfing this summer when my best friend and dorm roommate told
                    me that he was starting to enjoy golfing.  From that point, I bought my first set of *used* golf club set and accessories from ebay.  As time of writing this, I have gone to the driving range at least once a week since that point, and

                    I started doing some very minor trading when I first turned 18, but I left it alone until I got to college where I started to get back to it.  In April of my freshman year I started doing some investing with Bitcoin and Litecoin with Robinhood's
                    cryptocurrency trading platform, and since then I have continued to do trading in Bitcoin, stocks, and options with a much more diversified portfolio.  During the stock market crash when C");

                    starting with bitcoin in April of 2019, I contribute that to more luck than anything since I don't have much knowledge on how to properly make trading decisions.
